    <title>How Burst Pool work</title>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
    <li><b>Minimum payout is 250 Burst</b></li>
    <li><b>Pool fee is 1.5%</b></li>
    <li><b>Transaction fee is 0.5%</b> (or minimum 1 burst as required by the network)</li>
    <li><b>Payment is instant when pool has positive balance</b></li>
    <li><b>Share value reduction is 50% per block</b></li>
        <p> if pool on current round does not find a block, miners shares are keep (up to 50 blocks),
            but their value is reduced by 50% everytime we dont found a block.
            when pool has positive balance, all share are summed up to block# where payment will be made,
            and burst payment are made proportional to total share miners own up to this time
        </p>
    <li><b>Block forward allocation is 50%</b></li>
        <p> if pool has a balance (lets say 10000 burst),
            5000 are distributed for miner proportional to their shares up to current block as payment,
            the rest 5000 burst will be allocated and paid for next round, (whether we found a block or not),
            this allocation continue until pool balance is drained out
        </p>
    <li><b>No Deadline limit</b></li>
        <p> deadline value from miner is converted into share value using this equation<br/>
            share = 1000 / ( NetDiff * Deadline + 1 ) <sup>0.75</sup><br/>
            where NetDiff (network difficulty) is calculated by Block0-BaseTarget / Block#N-BaseTarget<br/><br/>
            <b>note</b> : to prevent user spamming low share, we implement share penalty of -0.001 on each submission
            for miners who submit nonce that has higher deadline than their (current round) own best deadline, as spamming
            low share is no use since pool will always pick one best deadline for every submitted nonce per round.
